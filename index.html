            <h2>A brief summary of Dr.Homi Bhabha's journey</h2>
            <h3>Early life and education</h3>
            <p>
                    Homi Jehangir Bhabha was born on 30 October 1909 into a prominent wealthy Parsi family comprising Jehangir Hormusji Bhabha, 
                a well-known lawyer,  and Meherbai Framji Panday,granddaughter of Sir Dinshaw Maneckji Petit.He was named Hormusji after his
                paternal grandfather, Hormusji Bhabha, who was Inspector-General of Education in Mysore. He received his early  studies at
                Mumbai's Cathedral and John Connon School.
                Bhabha's upbringing instilled in him an appreciation for music, painting and gardening. He often visited his maternal aunt 
                Meherbai Tata, who owned a Western classical music collection which included the works of Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn around 
                Schubert.Together with his brother and his cousin, it was a ritual for him to listen to records from this collection over 
                the gramophone.Bhabha also received special violin and piano lessons. His tutor in sketching and painting was the artist
                 Jehangir Lalkala. At seventeen, Bhabha's self-portrait won second place at the prestigious Bombay Art Society's exhibition. Bhabha frequently visited the home of his uncle Dorabji Tata, chairman of
                 the conglomerate Tata Group and then one of the wealthiest men in India.
            <br>
            

            Though he passed his Senior Cambridge Examination with honours at the age of fifteen, he was too young to join any college abroad. 
            So, he enrolled in Elphinstone College. He then attended the Royal Institute of Science in 1927, where he witnessed a public 
            lecture by Arthur Compton, who would win the Nobel Prize in physics the next year for his 1923 discovery of the Compton effect.
             Bhabha later said that he first heard of cosmic rays, the subject of his future research, at this lecture.
            
            
            The following year, he joined Gonville and Caius College of Cambridge University. This was due to the insistence of his father 
            and his uncle Dorabji, who planned for Bhabha to obtain a degree in mechanical engineering from Cambridge and then return to India,
             where he would join the Tata Steel mills in Jamshedpur as a metallurgist.

            <h3>Career</h3>
            <p>
                Indian Institute of Science
                Bhabha had returned to India for his annual vacation before the start of World War II in September 1939.
                 War prompted him to remain in India, where he accepted a post of reader in physics at the Indian Institute of 
                 Science in Bengaluru headed by Nobel laureate C.V. Raman.In 1940, the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust supported his
                  experimental cosmic ray physics research with a grant.
<br>
                Bhabha was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1941, and the following year he became the first Indian to received 
                the Adams Prize. Soon after receiving the Adams Prize, Bhabha was also made a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences 
                and President of the Physics section of the Indian Sciences Congress.
                During his time in Bengaluru, Bhabha met Vikram and Mrinalini Sarabhai as part of a group interested in Indian 
                culture, and developed an appreciation for Indian architectural and artistic heritage on his tours around the country.
                In a 1944 letter, he expressed a change of mind and a desire to stay in India:

        On 26 April 1948, Bhabha wrote to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that "the development of atomic energy should be entrusted to a 
        very small and high-powered body composed of say three people with executive power, and answerable directly to the Prime Minister 
        without any intervening link. For brevity, this body may be referred to as the Atomic Energy Commission."

            </p>
            
            <h3>Awards and honours</h3>
            <p>
                Bhabha's doctoral thesis won him the Adams Prize in 1942,making him the first Indian to receive the honour.
                This was followed by a Hopkins Prize by the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1948.He gained international prominence
                 after deriving a correct expression for the probability of scattering positrons by electrons, a process now known as 
                 Bhabha scattering. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1951 and 1953–1956.

                  He was awarded Padma Bhushan, India's third-highest civilian honour, in 1954.In 1957, he was elected an honorary
                   fellow of Gonville and Caius College and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.Bhabha received several honorary doctoral degrees in science throughout
                    his career: Patna (1944), Lucknow (1949), Banaras (1950), Agra (1952), Perth (1954), Allahabad (1958), Cambridge (1959),
                     London (1960) and Padova (1961).
            </p>
            <h3>Death</h3>
            <p>
            Bhabha died when Air India Flight 101 crashed near Mont Blanc on 24 January 1966. A misunderstanding between
             Geneva Airport and the pilot about the aircraft position near the mountain is the official reason of the crash.
             Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said in a ceremony mourning his death:

            To lose Dr Homi Bhabha at this crucial moment in the development of our atomic energy programme is a terrible blow
             for our nation. He had his most creative years ahead of him. When we take up the unfinished work he has left behind, 
             we will realize in how many fields he served us. 
              We mourn a great son of India.
